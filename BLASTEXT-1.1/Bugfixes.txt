7/17/22
=Extension pop up and data saving features active
=Can now copy an entire table of results at once
7/21/22
-Fixed issues with redundant variables
-Changed delimiter to tab instead of something weird

-Less ambigous error message when clearing data
7/22/22
-Index of recalled save button to disable was off by negative 1, replaced "buttonID = i++" with "buttonID = i+1"
7/29/22
-Result array is properly refresehed on new instance
>If results table gets large enough it covers the menu tabs
>Copy table button still busted
